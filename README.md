# parser

A PCFG parser for natural-language texts, using CYK algorithm.

Free, open-source.

Usage
-----
Call the class com.github.asher_stern.parser.api.ParseFilesKt with the following arguments:
1. sentences-file
2. destination-file

The sentences-file contains sentences tagged with part-of-speech.
Each line in the sentences-file corresponds to a single word.
Sentences are separated with a blank line.

Each word is given as: word TAB part-of-speech.
For example:
<pre>
John	NNP
loves	VBZ
Marry	NNP
.	.

Marry	NNP
loves	VBZ
John	NNP
.	.
</pre>
The part-of-speech tags must be Penn part-of-speech tags, or punctuation marks.

A third command-line-arguments is optional, for a directory containing the model files generated by the training program.
If the third argument is omitted, then the default models, bundled in this project are used.
Those models were trained using the free 10% of Penn Treebank.


Train
-----
Call the class com.github.asher_stern.parser.api.TrainKt with the following arguments:
1. Penn treebank directory, containing all the ".mrg" files.
2. Destination directory, into where the new model files will be generated.
This destination directory can then be used as a third parameter of the parsing entry-point (see above).
